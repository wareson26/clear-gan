**CLEAR-GAN: Locality-aware Hybrid Resampling for Ordinal Multiclass Imbalance with Class Overlap**

## Proprietary dataset

In addition to the public datasets, the manuscript evaluates CLEAR-GAN using a proprietary student dataset collected at a public university in Ghana.

### Dataset description
The proprietary dataset consists of anonymised academic records of undergraduate students tracked over multiple academic periods.
Each instance represents a student trajectory, with features capturing cumulative academic performance, progression indicators, and engagement-related attributes measured across successive semesters. The target variable is an ordinal academic outcome label reflecting overall performance status.

The dataset exhibits substantial class imbalance and pronounced overlap between adjacent performance categories, making it representative of real-world ordinal classification challenges in educational settings.

### Metadata summary
- Domain: Higher education  
- Task: Ordinal multiclass classification  
- Structure: temporal (multiple academic periods per student)  
- Features: The dataset includes demographic attributes (Gender, Age, Region), academic background indicators (Grade, Programme, Exams_attempt, Is_Choice, Bursary), semester-level performance measures (Semester_1 to Semester_8), and an aggregated final performance indicator (FGPA). The prediction target is an ordinal academic outcome class.
- Target variable: Ordinal academic performance category  
- Class distribution: Imbalanced with overlapping adjacent classes  
- Data type: Tabular, numeric, and categorical (encoded)

### Availability
Due to privacy and ethical considerations, the proprietary dataset is not publicly available and cannot be redistributed.  
An anonymised version of the dataset may be made available upon reasonable request from the corresponding author.




All public datasets used in this study are publicly available.  
No dataset files are committed to this repository.  
Instead, notebooks download the data directly from the original sources to ensure licensing compliance and reproducibility.
