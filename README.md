# CLEAR-GAN
CLEAR-GAN is a data-centric hybrid resampling framework developed to jointly address class imbalance and class overlap in ordinal multiclass datasets. The method constrains overlap analysis to adjacent class pairs and integrates boundary-preserving undersampling with conditional generative oversampling to improve minority discrimination while maintaining decision boundary stability.
